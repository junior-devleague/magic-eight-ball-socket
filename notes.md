# Notes

### What is a Socket?
  - A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines
  - It is simply a pipe that will deliver the stuff from one end to another end
  - The medium is the local area network
  
Server
  - A server is a machine which waits for requests from a client machine and then serves or processes the requests
  
Client
  - The client is the requester of the services
  
### Objective
The objective is to set up a simple client server socket program using Python, where we establish a connection through the socket to talk between the client and the server 

What we are going to do...

1. Create a server.py file to hold the server code that will listen for client connection
2. Create a client.py file
